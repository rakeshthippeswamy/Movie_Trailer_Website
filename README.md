# Movie_Trailer_Website
Movie trailer website allows you to browse the trailers of my all time favorite movies written in Python and HTML.

## Install

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) before running the code.
I have used Python 2.7.12 version to write this code.

## Usage

It is a simple code which has a single _Class_ with variables like _title, storyline, poster image, and a youtube trailer_.

The source for the **fresh_tomatoes.py** is udacity, which consists of a HTML file used to create the static website. A movie list is created and provided as input to the  **fresh_tomatoes.py**. 

## How it works...
Run the **entertainment_center.py** file.

Click on the movie trailer you want to watch.

Enjoy the trailer.
